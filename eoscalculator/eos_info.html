                        Probability of Neonatal Early-Onset Sepsis Based on Maternal Risk Factors and the Infant's Clinical Presentation
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                    This tool is intended for the use of clinicians trained and experienced in the care of newborn infants. Using this tool, the risk of early-onset sepsis can be calculated in an infant born > 34 weeks gestation. The interactive calculator produces the probability of early onset sepsis per 1000 babies by entering values for the specified maternal risk factors along with the infant's clinical presentation.
